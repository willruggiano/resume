  abstract = {Log-structured merge (LSM) trees offer efficient ingestion by appending incoming data, and thus, are widely used as the storage layer of production NoSQL data stores. To enable competitive read performance, LSM-trees periodically re-organize data to form a tree with levels of exponentially increasing capacity, through iterative compactions. Compactions fundamentally influence the performance of an LSM-engine in terms of write amplification, write throughput, point and range lookup performance, space amplification, and delete performance. Hence, choosing the appropriate compaction strategy is crucial and, at the same time, hard as the LSM-compaction design space is vast, largely unexplored, and has not been formally defined in the literature. As a result, most LSM-based engines use a fixed compaction strategy, typically hand-picked by an engineer, which decides how and when to compact data.In this paper, we present the design space of LSM-compactions, and evaluate state-of-the-art compaction strategies with respect to key performance metrics. Toward this goal, our first contribution is to introduce a set of four design primitives that can formally define any compaction strategy: (i) the compaction trigger, (ii) the data layout, (iii) the compaction granularity, and (iv) the data movement policy. Together, these primitives can synthesize both existing and completely new compaction strategies. Our second contribution is to experimentally analyze 10 compaction strategies. We present 12 observations and 7 high-level takeaway messages, which show how LSM systems can navigate the compaction design space.}

  abstract = {The first comprehensive treatment of active inference, an integrative perspective on brain, cognition, and behavior used across multiple disciplines.Active inference is a way of understanding sentient behavior—a theory that characterizes perception, planning, and action in terms of probabilistic inference. Developed by theoretical neuroscientist Karl Friston over years of groundbreaking research, active inference provides an integrated perspective on brain, cognition, and behavior that is increasingly used across multiple disciplines including neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy. Active inference puts the action into perception. This book offers the first comprehensive treatment of active inference, covering theory, applications, and cognitive domains. Active inference is a “first principles” approach to understanding behavior and the brain, framed in terms of a single imperative to minimize free energy. The book emphasizes the implications of the free energy principle for understanding how the brain works. It first introduces active inference both conceptually and formally, contextualizing it within current theories of cognition. It then provides specific examples of computational models that use active inference to explain such cognitive phenomena as perception, attention, memory, and planning.},
