<p>My background is actually in architecture (i.e. undergrad) and I have
been mostly self-taught in the ways of coding (though I have had several
incredible colleagues and mentors along the way). It started with Java -
I wrote my first main method with the help of a Dummies Guide :) Years
later I learned C++ while working on a real-time streaming protocol at
AWS, and this really sparked my interested in the lower levels: the
network stack, memory management, the <em>type system</em> and compiler.
Around that time I also found <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim">neovim</a> which fueled many
a late night, side project. Most recently I’ve been learning a new
language, <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig">Zig</a>, and becoming
increasingly interested in machine learning. I’ve primarily fueled this
interest by (a) reading academic papers like “Attention Is All You Need”
and books like “Why Machines Learn”, and (b) applying various learnings
in the context of a practical syllabus like <a

lectures</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Software Engineer, Tendrel</strong><br> 2023–</p>
<ul>
<li>The usual web stack: React, Typescript, NextJS/<a
href="https://github.com/tendrelhq/graphql">GraphQL</a>, Postgres.</li>
<li>Led the development and release of our most “successful”
application.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Software Engineer, Amazon/AWS</strong><br> 2016–2023</p>
<ul>
<li>Joined Amazon out of college.</li>
<li>Spent four-ish years on the retail side with the Notifications team.
More or less: SOA, Java, DynamoDB.</li>
<li>Worked with two phenomenal engineers to design, build and deploy a
new notifications service, and then migrate/deprecate the legacy (Perl)
service.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
<li>Stumbled upon Apple’s iOS rich-content push notification APIs, and
then led its integration into Amazon’s iOS mobile application.<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
<li>Transitioned to AWS to try something new. Landed on a team building
a real-time streaming protocol for AWS’s VDI products.</li>
<li>Worked primarily with one other engineer on the core protocol/shared
library. C++(17), UDP, STUN/TURN and a little bit of Python mixed in for
sanity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Undergrad (Architecture), University of Virginia</strong><br>
2012-2016</p>
<ul>
<li>I loved Legos as a kid, so architecture seemed like the perfect fit
:D</li>
<li>First coding experience: Python in Grasshopper (Rhino 3D).</li>
<li>Managed to complete a CS minor in my final 3 semesters, ironically
<em>after</em> I’d already gotten a SWE job.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s some interesting stuff in here, mainly around the so-called
“state machine” mechanism. This repo was the backend for the Runtime
application during my time at Tendrel. A rather detailed description of
how this application was intended to work can be found <a
href="https://github.com/tendrelhq/graphql/blob/main/docs/runtime.md">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="neovim.drv"><a

<p>This is my personal developer environment, packaged as a <a
href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> flake. You’ll find mostly Lua and Nix
code in here, all for the configuration of <a
href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim">neovim</a>. For yet more <a
href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> code see the <a
href="https://github.com/willruggiano/neovim.nix">library I use to do
the heavy lifting</a>.</p>

<p>I am a co-maintainer of this repo. Its purpose is to make nightly <a
href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim">neovim</a> accessible to the <a
href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> ecosystem. Unsurprisingly you’ll find
only <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> code in there.</p>
<h3 id="dotfiles"><a
href="https://github.com/willruggiano/dotfiles">dotfiles</a></h3>
<p>I guess I’ll include this one since it demonstrates a modicum of
knowledge about Linux and “system administration”. It’s mostly <a
href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> code (do you see a pattern?) and
contains the system configurations for my laptop and desktop.</p>

<li id="fn2"><p>This had two big effects: (1) During migration, I
uncovered a bug in the legacy system that resulted in a substantial
amount of high volume notifications being dropped, ~20% or so if I
recall correctly, which meant a lot of money down the drain. I got a
promotion out of it :) (2) We cut our infrastructure bill by 70% (even
with the 20% bump in traffic)<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn3"><p>I don’t have raw numbers on this one but we targetted
the high volume use cases first (enabled by [^2])… so, somewhere on the
order of the count of Amazon retail orders.<a href="#fnref3"
